Simple Snake Game Using jQuery

There are several tutorials on the internet to create simple snake game in query. I readh through https://www.sourcecodester.com/tutorials/javascript/11260/creating-very-simple-snake-game-using-jquery.html and decided to enhance it.

The new code has following advantages over the original one:
1. Added pause and play option
2. Once the game ends, stops play. Original code just restarted the game
3. Changed the position of game name and score
4. Replaced absolute font size with relative sizes.
